# 19 - Mongoose(Mongo) #

## Mongoose ##
It represents our data/documents as Javascript objects. The schema is the foundation for the models. Similar to Laravel’s ORM.

1. $ cd projects 
2. $ express jrp19
3. $ cd jrp19
4. open the folder in Atom
5. open package.json
6. $ npm install --save mongoose
7. should see package.json change
8. $npm install
9. In Atom
    1. add mongoose require & connection
    2. add schema
    3. add model

—this one is not needed now…i think (install express-mongoose / mongoose (try and install mongoose/express-mongoose and then manually adding it to package.json??))
