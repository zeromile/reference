CONDITIONALS
Conditionals http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp
- A conditional is a control structure that looks a lot like a function
- It contains:
    - a logical declaration (if, while, etc)
    - a logical expression to be evaluated
    - a functional block of code to execute depending on the truthiness of the logical expression
    - optional alternate or nested conditional

Challenge: Add code that picks image 5 if the  phrase (question) is entered in the magic 8 ball field
