# 12 - Express, Express Generator, Jade, and Node #

## Modules & Packages ##
Node is a global-scope application. You can run it from the command prompt in any folder. The command prompt knows what it is. However, if you want to run a specific node application (i.e. a specific .js file) you have to run node from within the folder where that application (.js file) is located.

The default install of Node, just like the default JS interpreter built-in to your browser, can run straight JavaScript without any additional help. However, in the browser, JavaScript is extensible through libraries and frameworks to make the heavy lifting in JavaScript less heavy. One popular library is jQuery, and a popular framework is Angular. 

Just as browser JavaScript is extensible, so is Node, through modules. A module provides a single piece of functionality. When modules are combined they are referred to as a package. Modules within a package may often have dependencies in order to operate, making it different than a library or framework (which can stand on their own). 

Installing a package requires downloading the modules from repositories, making sure you get the right versions that play together, and also finding and installing the dependent modules.

## NPM ##
These packages can be quite complex but thankfully node has a built-in manager for packages called NPM.

Tonight we are going to learn how to use ExpressJS. Express is the “E” part of the MEAN Stack and it is a frame
