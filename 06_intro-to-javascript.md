# 06 - Intro to Javascript #

Javascript is a dynamic language - that means that elements of the program can change while its running. This is possible because JavaScript is a runtime-compiled language - its converted to machine executable code on the fly. That means it needs another application to run; it needs another application to convert it to executable code.

Most often the application that runs JavaScript is a browser. The Javascript is downloaded inside of an HTML file - or its called from an HTML file - and then executed by the browser. Because its running in the browser it has access to information and functionality that’s built-in to the browser. AND because there are different browser makers they each interpret JavaScript a little differently. They are the same for the most part but there are still some differences. 

This is one of the advantages of using a framework like Angular or jQuery…they abstract out all the browser differences so that we can use a common language specification and the framework takes over and re-interprets to accommodate browser quirks.

Javascript can also run locally or on a Web server using Node.js as the interpreter. This allows us to create dynamic applications and Web sites. 

We are going to start development in the browser and then move on to Node. Node is the “N” in MEAN stack.

METHODS vs PROPERTIES

In programming there are the concepts of methods and properties. It’s very important for us to fully grasp the meaning of these two terms because they are foundational to what we will be doing with JavaScript.

In a nutshell, METHODS are actions and PROPERTIES are descriptions.

When talking about people our “methods” are the things we can do. What are some things that people can do?

Our properties describe things about us. What are some properties of us?

VARIABLES (properties)

Variables are containers with names. Sometimes they hold numbers, sometimes they hold other variables, and sometimes they hold programs.

Variables can refer to properties or methods


FUNCTIONS (methods)

Functions are methods. They are encapsulated pieces of code that have a predefined purpose.

Both variables and functions have names.

Project ideas:
- Button that changes background color
- buttons that change out css class assignments (will need to make a page with assigned css)
- button to reset a form (will need to make a form)
