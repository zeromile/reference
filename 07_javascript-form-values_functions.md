# 07 - Javascript form values, functions #

- Finish magic 8-ball
- Add Bootstrap to make the app look pretty


FORM VALUES
- we can use JavaScript to access the values of form inputs
    - document.getElementById(“”).value;

Challenge: Add code to our magic 8-ball function that will write out the input value to a div above the image


FUNCTIONS
- A function will only execute when called
    - You can call it 
        - from within another function
        - from within the code
        - from an event listener
        - as part of a callback function
        - from the HTML (old school)
- There are different ways to create functions but we are going to focus on the most common way:
    - Function declaration, the function name, arguments (parameters), and the code to be executed
- Parameters
- Return values

Challenge: Build a function that adds two numbers together and writes the product out to console
