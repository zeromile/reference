# 04 - Bootstrap #

Bootstrap also include built in JavaScript widgets like tabs, carousels and accordion menus

Started as Twitter bootstrap


WHY USE IT?
The reason for bootstrap is in its name. The term “bootstrapping” in business refers to the process of getting a business running with the minimally required effort. The business product term “MVP” (minimum viable product) describes a product that is just good enough for people to get the idea, to understand what you want your product to do. The MVP is usually made by a bootstrapped company. So Bootstrap, the framework, was originally created as a quick way to build a good looking Web site without fighting browser inconsistencies or layout quirks. 

Once you know bootstrap you can use it to quickly build an MVP, utilizing built in responsive layouts and predefined code snippets, without having to worry about browser compatibility.
